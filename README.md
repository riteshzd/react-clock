# React Clock

The React-Clock application is a dynamic webpage which displays the current time for all available
timezones in either Digital format or Analog format as per the User's choice. The User can also opt
for a Dark mode as per choice. 

The application is built using React js and each clock is a separate component as it can be found in the 
Components folder.

npm start
